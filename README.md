This repo holds the official pytorch implementation of paper: ["AdaTAD: End-to-End Temporal Action Detection with 1B Parameters Across 1000 Frames"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17241)

## Updates
- Along with the release of AdaTAD, we will also release a TAD codebase consisting of more than 10 state-of-the-art TAD methods and supporting 5 TAD datasets. Stay tuned!
